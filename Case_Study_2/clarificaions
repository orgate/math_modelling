Traffic Flow (single land traffic) slides
related to Numerical Schemes.
I have discussed the general theory
(scalar nonlinear conservation laws)
and the mathematical models for the
traffic flow (so no special notes on this)
in the class.

Case Study II Questions:
1. Understand the theory behind, the mathematical
model and the numerical scheme (refer the slides).
2. Implement the numerical schemes (do it in Matlab
or Python).
3. Consider appropriate initial data and run the program.
4. Present your results.
5. Extra exercise (though not related to traffic flow)
check the numerical scheme for the flux f(u)=u^2/2 with
the initial data u(0,x) = 1 for x<0, 1-x for 0<=x<=1, 0 for x>1
and show the solution breaks at time t=1.
